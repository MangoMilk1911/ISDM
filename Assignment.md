### POV Statements
1. Relationship Managers need to be routed to potential customers based on skill levels and best match so the number of calls RMs have to take is reduced. (Might need rewording)
2. Outbound customers need to be matched with a Relationship Manager who is best fit to discuss the proposed product for the customer.
3. Inbound customers need to be matched with Relationship Managers according to their inquiry so they can recieve help and purchase a travel package more efficiently.

### Design Approach Reflection
This development project began with reading over the assigned case study and applying to it the first stage of Design Thinking: Empathise. From the disucssion topic we defined the stakeholders involved with and affected by the implementation of a travel company call routing system. 

We created empathy maps for the major stakeholders who we believed would be most affected and have the most perspective on the changed system. Our empathy maps were created for inbound and outbound customers and the call management centre Relationship Managers. Alongisde our empathy maps we created corresponding POV (point of view) statements which defined the stakeholders' needs and perspectives in relation to the call system. 

From the empathy maps and POV statements, we've been able to define the problem as part of stage 2 of the Design Thinkng process. We've determined that for customers, it is important to decrease wait time for calls and for them to be matched with an RM suited to their needs and questions. For RMs, it is important to be well matched with customers to best address their needs.

Following this we developed 'How might we?" (HMW) questions. These questions are shaped from our POV statements and frame our brainstorming and ideation phase:

#### HMW (How Might We) Questions
1. How might we improve customer retention and satisfaction.
2. How might we increase the rate of calls.
3. How might we increase the quality of our Relationship Managers' service.
4. How might we better consolidate our customer profiling tools.

We then listed our assumptions that were not explicitly stated in the case study:

#### Assumptions
* The user profile is created via a website and the user provides their profile id during the call to identify them.
* The travel company has a great need to improve its systems.
* Not all inbound customers will have profiles.
* Customers are not willing to wait long periods.

Applying the initial stages of Design Thinking to this project has allowed us to better understand the project scope, our design objectives and empathise with our stakeholders' needs and wants. Design Thinking stages 1 and 2 have set a foundation for us to proceed with the prototyping and modelling stage of our project. Understanding our objectives has also helped us create and prioritise our backlog which is managed using *Issues* on GitHub (See Backlog).

## Agile Development Methodology

### Backlog
1. As a Relationship Manager, I need to be matched with potential customers to best address their needs and interests.
2. As an Outbound Customer, I want to speak to someone who knows what they're talking about so my time isn't wasted.
3. As an inbound customer, I want to receive quick and sounds advice/options on travel options so that I can make an informed decision on the travel options.
5. As a Relationship Manager, I want to be able to view customers quickly and with ease so I can deliver high quality service.
