## Problem Definition
## Project Objectives

## Stakeholders
1. **Inbound Call Customer:** Customers calling the travel company to purchase or get information about a travel package
2. **Outbound Call Customer:** Potential customers called by the travel company
3. **Relationship Manager (RM):** Employees who talk to to customers over the phone
4. **Call Management Centre (CMC):** A department within the travel company that manages both inbound and outbound calls
5. **Travel Company:** The major travel company who maintains the call management centre

## Design Thinking

### POV Statements
1. Relationship Managers need to be routed to potential customers based on skill levels and best match so the number of calls RMs have to take is reduced. (Might need rewording)
2. Outbound customers need to be matched with a Relationship Manager who is best fit to discuss the proposed product for the customer.
3. Inbound customers need to be matched with Relationship Managers according to their inquiry so they can recieve help and purchase a travel package more efficiently.

### Design Approach Reflection
This development project began with reading over the assigned case study and applying to it the first stage of Design Thinking: Empathise. From the disucssion topic we defined the stakeholders involved with and affected by the implementation of a travel company call routing system. 

We created empathy maps for the major stakeholders who we believed would be most affected and have the most perspective on the changed system. Our empathy maps were created for inbound and outbound customers and the call management centre Relationship Managers. Alongisde our empathy maps we created corresponding POV (point of view) statements which defined the stakeholders' needs and perspectives in relation to the call system. 

From the empathy maps and POV statements, we've been able to define the problem as part of stage 2 of the Design Thinkng process. We've determined that for customers, it is important to decrease wait time for calls and for them to be matched with an RM suited to their needs and questions. For RMs, it is important to be well matched with customers to best address their needs.

Following this we developed 'How might we?" (HMW) questions. These questions are shaped from our POV statements and frame our brainstorming and ideation phase:

#### HMW (How Might We) Questions
1. How might we improve customer retention and satisfaction.
2. How might we increase the rate of calls.
3. How might we increase the quality of our Relationship Managers' service.
4. How might we better consolidate our customer profiling tools.

We then listed our assumptions that were not explicitly stated in the case study:

#### Assumptions
* The user profile is created with a Profiler Tool via a website and the user provides their profile id during the call to identify them.
* The customer score from 1-10 is calculated based on repeat purchases and postcode.
* Outbound customers are contacted based on their score during peak travelling seasons.
* The RM skill score is given from 1-10.
* The travel company has a great need to improve its systems.
* Not all inbound customers will have profiles.
* Customers are not willing to wait long periods.
* All inbound calls are atleast partially filtered by the system.
* All outbound calls performed by RM's are taken from their target list.

Applying the initial stages of Design Thinking to this project has allowed us to better understand the project scope, our design objectives and empathise with our stakeholders' needs and wants. Design Thinking stages 1 and 2 have set a foundation for us to proceed with the prototyping and modelling stage of our project. Understanding our objectives has also helped us create and prioritise our backlog which is managed using *Issues* on GitHub (See Backlog).

## Agile Development Methodology

### Backlog
1. As a Relationship Manager, I need to be matched with potential customers to best address their needs and interests.
2. As an Outbound Customer, I want to speak to someone who knows what they're talking about so my time isn't wasted.
3. As an inbound customer, I want to receive quick and sounds advice/options on travel options so that I can make an informed decision on the travel options.
5. As a Relationship Manager, I want to be able to view customers quickly and with ease so I can deliver high quality service.
6. As an Inbound Customer, I want to be directed to a employee quickly so that I can get information or purchase a product quickly.
7. As an Inbound Customer, I want to be able to provide my ID so I can be served based off my previous purchases and interests. (Assumption for this needed?)
8. As a Relationship Manager, I want a list of potential customers to be generated for me so that I can efficiently contact potential customers.
9. As a Relationship Manager, I want the list of potential customers to be generated based off my profile and knowledge so that I can be more helpful.
10. As a Relationship Manager, I want to be able to quickly view important information about a customer so that I can easily access information related to the specific customer.
11. As a Relationship Manager, I want a dialouge script to be automatically generated so that I can improve easily access necessary information regarding the customers inquiry.
12. As a Relationship Manager, I want to be connected to customers who are more likely to purchase so that I can make more sales.
13. As a Outbound Customer, I want to be able to opt out of getting calls from the Travel Company so that I do not get spammed.
