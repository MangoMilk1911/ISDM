### POV Statements
1. Relationship Managers need to be routed to potential customers based on skill levels and best match so the number of calls RMs have to take is reduced. (Might need rewording)
2. Outbound customers need to be matched with a Relationship Manager who is best fit to discuss the proposed product for the customer.
3. Inbound customers need to be matched with Relationship Managers according to their inquiry so they can recieve help and purchase a travel package more efficiently.

### Design Approach Reflection

### HMW (How Might We) Questions
1. How might we improve customer retention and satisfaction.
2. How might we increase the rate of calls.
3. How might we increase the quality of our Relationship Managers' service.
4. How might we better consolidate our customer profiling tools.

### Assumptions
* The user profile is created via a website and the user provides their profile id during the call to identify them.
* The travel company has a great need to improve its systems.
* Not all inbound customers will have profiles.
* Customers are not willing to wait long periods.

## Agile Development Methodology

### Backlog
1. As a Relationship Manager, I need to be matched with potential customers to best address their needs and interests.
2. As an Outbound Customer, I want to speak to someone who knows what they're talking about so my time isn't wasted.
3. As an inbound customer, I want to receive quick and sounds advice/options on travel options so that I can make an informed decision on the travel options.
5. As a Relationship Manager, I want to be able to view customers quickly and with ease so I can deliver high quality service.
