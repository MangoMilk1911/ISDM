### POV Statements
1. Relationship Managers need to be routed to potential customers based on skill levels and best match so the number of calls RMs have to take is reduced. (Might need rewording)
2. Outbound customers need to be matched with Relationship Managers according to their inquiry so they can recieve help and purchase a travel package more efficiently.
